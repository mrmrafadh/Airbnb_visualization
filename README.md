Libraries/Modules needed for the project!
Plotly - (To plot and visualize the data)
Pandas - (To Clean and maipulate the data)
Streamlit - (To Create Graphical user Interface)
Workflow :
Step 1 :
Establish a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset.

Step 2 :
Clean the Airbnb dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types as necessary. Prepare the dataset for EDA and visualization tasks, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

Step 3 :
Develop a streamlit web application that utilizes the geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset to create interactive maps.

Step 4 :
Use the cleaned data to analyze and visualize how prices vary across different locations, property types, and seasons. Create dynamic plots and charts that enable users to explore price trends, outliers, and correlations with other variables.
